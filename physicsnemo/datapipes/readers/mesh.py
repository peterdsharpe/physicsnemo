        extra_boundaries : dict[str, dict] or None, optional
            Load additional sibling meshes as extra boundaries on each
            sample.  Each key is the boundary name to assign; each value
            is a dict with a ``"pattern"`` key giving a glob pattern
            (relative to the sample's parent directory) to find the mesh
            file.  These meshes are loaded at full resolution and are
            **not** subsampled, making them suitable for geometric
            queries like SDF computation.

            Example::

                extra_boundaries:
                  stl_geometry:
                    pattern: "*_single_solid.stl.pmsh"
        drop_interior_cells : bool, default=False
            If True, discard the interior mesh's cell connectivity (and
            cell_data) immediately after load, turning it into a point
            cloud.  This makes ``subsample_n_points`` take the cheap
            contiguous-block path instead of the expensive
            ``slice_points`` remap (which allocates an ``n_points`` map
            and scatter-reads the full cell array from the memmap).  Use
            for point-based models that consume only ``interior.points``
            and ``interior.point_data`` (e.g. GeoTransolver volume) and
            never the interior tet/cell topology.  Boundaries are
            unaffected, so surface normals etc. still work.
        drop_in_file_boundaries : bool, default=False
            If True, discard the boundaries stored *in* the DomainMesh
            file immediately after load (before subsampling and pinning).
            ``extra_boundaries`` are added afterwards and are therefore
            unaffected.  Use when the model consumes only the interior
            (plus any ``extra_boundaries``) and never the in-file
            boundaries -- e.g. a volume pipeline whose SDF comes from an
            injected STL, where the in-file car-surface boundary would
            otherwise be subsampled (an expensive ``slice_points`` remap,
            GIL-held, that blocks worker-thread overlap) and pinned every
